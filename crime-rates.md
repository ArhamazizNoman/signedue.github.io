# Crime Rates

This page gives an overview of crime rates in Danish municipalities from 2008 to 2024, based on official statistics.

We focus on the five municipalities with the highest average crime rates and the five with the lowest. The goal is to provide a starting point for exploring how crime varies across the country and over time.

The visualizations are interactive to make it easier to compare and spot trends. While we don't aim to explain why the differences exist, this page can help highlight where patterns may be worth looking into further.
