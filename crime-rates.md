# Crime Rates in Danish Municipalities

This page gives an overview of crime rates in Danish municipalities from 2008 to 2024.

We focus on the five municipalities with the highest average crime rates and the five with the lowest.
The crime rate is calculated for each year by dividing the number of reported crimes by the population of the municipality that year. To allow for fair comparisons, we express this as the number of crimes per 10,000 residents.
The goal is to provide a starting point for exploring how crime varies across the country and over time. 

The visualizations are interactive to make it easier to compare and spot trends. While we don't aim to explain why the differences exist, this page can help highlight where patterns may be worth looking into further.
