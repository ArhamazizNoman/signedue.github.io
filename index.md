# Welcome

We wanted to explore **crime**, **income**, and **education** across the municipalities of Denmark to see if there are any notable **patterns** or **correlations** between them.

In the navigation bar, you'll find:
- A dedicated analysis of each topic: **Crime**, **Education**, and **Income**.
- A combined view that explores how these dimensions relate to each other.

Each section includes interactive visualizations and brief explanations aimed at making the data both accessible and insightful.
